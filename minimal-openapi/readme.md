This SaaS project was bootstrapped with [Saasify](https://saasify.sh).

This template "saasifies" an example [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) pointing to [httbin.org](https://httpbin.org). Saasify acts as a proxy in front of this API to transparently handle authentication, billing, rate limiting, usage tracking, caching, and other production concerns.

Once you're ready, you'll want to replace this OpenAPI spec with one representing your externally hosted API.

_Note that an OpenAPI spec is no longer required to use Saasify_. Including an OpenAPI spec allows Saasify to auto-generate API docs for your product. It also allows Saasify to perform additional validation as it proxies HTTP calls to your backend API.

See our [quick start](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/quick-start) for a walkthrough of how to get started and our [OpenAPI guide](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/openapi) for more information on generating your own OpenAPI spec.
