This SaaS project was bootstrapped with [Saasify](https://saasify.sh).

Note that this template includes an example OpenAPI spec pointing to a [fake JSON placeholder service](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

You'll want to replace this spec with one representing your externally hosted API's functionality. See this [guide](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/openapi) for more details.
