This SaaS project was bootstrapped with [Saasify](https://saasify.sh).

This template "saasifies" an example externally hosted API [httbin.org](https://httpbin.org). Saasify acts as a proxy in front of this API to transparently handle authentication, billing, rate limiting, usage tracking, caching, and other production concerns.

Once you're ready, you'll want to replace this `backendUrl` with a URL to your SaaS product's backend API.

See our [quick start](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/quick-start) for a walkthrough of how to get started.
